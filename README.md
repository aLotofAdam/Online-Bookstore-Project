# Online-Bookstore-Project
Proof-of-concept online bookstore with a simple webpage interface

## About This Project:
This was my final project for my relational database class. It had been years since I last used HTML and CSS, so I had to refresh my knowledge on those skills. I wrote the CSS as an internal stylesheet; I am now aware that this is bad practice. I had never used PHP or jQuery before, so I had to learn the basics in order to write my server-side code. I used XAMPP to create a local web server to test my code.

## Tech Stack Used: 
HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery, and MySQL.

## Requirements:
* Use SQL commands to create tables with primary and foreign keys.
*	Simple webpage interface.
*	Webpage should be able to query database and display tables.
*	Implement an administrator's transaction to insert new books with relevant data into the database.

**Figure 3:** Form drops down when "Admin Author Form" button is clicked. The Admin can add new authors to the database through this form. The ISBN is a foreign key in the AUTHORS table. It is used to add the authorID to the correct column of the BOOKS table.<br />
